This project is designed to test the ability to work with rendering and state management using React:

Installing packages via NPM
Running tests from the command line
Writing React function components
Using hooks like useState()
Debugging React code through console output

The app is for using the Pomodoro technique which is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks, 
however the app has the ability to increased the work interval up to 60 mins and breaks up tp 15 mins.
Each interval is known as a _pomodoro_, from the Italian word for _tomato_, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
